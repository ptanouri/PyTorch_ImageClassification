Neural Networks
Neural networks can be constructed using the torch.nn package.

Now that you had a glimpse of autograd, nn depends on autograd to define models and differentiate them. An nn.Module contains layers, and a method forward(input) that returns the output.

For example, look at this network that classifies digit images:

It is a simple feed-forward network. It takes the input, feeds it through several layers one after the other, and then finally gives the output.

A typical training procedure for a neural network is as follows:

Define the neural network that has some learnable parameters (or weights)

Iterate over a dataset of inputs

Process input through the network

Compute the loss (how far is the output from being correct)

Propagate gradients back into the networkâ€™s parameters

Update the weights of the network, typically using a simple update rule: weight = weight - learning_rate * gradient
